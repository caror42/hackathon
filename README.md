# hackathon
Projects completed in a 24-hr hackathon.

Starry Night Physics (aka star simmulation) is a model of the gravitational interactions of stars.
Star movement is implemented using Euler's method along with Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, Newton's second law, and basic DVAT equations.

The program comes with 4 preset star set ups: orbit, collision, dance and hive.
To choose a preset, only the single letter "o", "c", "d", and "h" are allowed.
Orbit shows one light star orbiting around a star that's 100x more massive.
The smaller star begins with velocity perpendicular to the direction of the massive star, initiating circular motion.
Collision shows two stars colliding reulting in a "splat" kilanova.
Dance shows the twirling interactions of 3 stars.
Hive randomizes the position, velocity, and mass of 10 stars.

Completely customizable star placement, mass, and x/y velocity is also possible by opting not to use presets.
Simply click to place the star and then enter basic info.
Any number of stars can be added, but computation times will stars to increase at higher quantities.

Enjoy!
